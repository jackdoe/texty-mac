*** WARNING: this is still work in porgress ***

1. idea
	the idea is very simple - single window-tab based text editor,
	which creates temporary files, auto saves them, backups everything on each
	save, and has diff between the current and each of the saved versions.

2. directories
everything is inside ~/TEXTY_DATA
/Users/jack/TEXTY_DATA/
/Users/jack/TEXTY_DATA/TEMPORARY/yyyy-MM-dd/TEMP-time().rand().txt
/Users/jack/TEXTY_DATA/BACKUP/full_file_url/time().txt
/Users/jack/TEXTY_DATA/AUTOSAVE/fill_file_url/filename

2.1 autosave/backup
	Every 60 seconds the temporary files are auto saved at their
	actual location (texty_data/temporaty/yyyy-MM-dd/..).
	Non temporary files are saved in texty_data/autosave../
	Every time you hit save, a backup is made inside BACKUP/.

3. execute
	on line number 2 (counting from 1 - ugh.) you can have:
	TEXTY_RUN_SHELL command
	if the command begins with http:// a modal window displaying the http
	page will be opened.
		example: TEXTY_RUN_SHELL http://localhost/~jack/index.php

	other wise a command is ran using /bin/sh -c "command"
		example: TEXTY_RUN_SHELL {MYSELF} arg1 arg2
		example: TEXTY_RUN_SHELL ~/script.sh arg1 {MYSELF} arg2
	{MYSELF} is auto replaced with the actual file you are editting.
	when you click run - a modal window with the output of the command will be displayed. 
	note: maximum time out for a job is 1 second, after that the task will be terminated.

4. syntax highlighting
	this is still very experimental and it doesnt support multi line stuff
